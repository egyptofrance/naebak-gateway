# ADR-001: API Gateway Architecture and Routing Strategy

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**

The Naebak platform consists of multiple microservices that need to be accessible to frontend applications and external clients. We needed to decide on the architecture for exposing these services, handling cross-cutting concerns like authentication, rate limiting, and providing a unified API interface. Several approaches were considered, including direct service exposure, a simple reverse proxy, and a comprehensive API gateway with intelligent routing and security features.

**Decision:**

We have decided to implement a comprehensive API gateway that serves as the single entry point for all microservices, handling authentication, routing, rate limiting, and providing a unified API interface for the Naebak platform.

## **Gateway Architecture Design:**

**Centralized Entry Point** provides a single URL endpoint for all client applications, simplifying client configuration and enabling centralized monitoring and security controls. This approach eliminates the need for clients to know individual service endpoints and handles service discovery transparently.

**Reverse Proxy Pattern** implements intelligent request routing based on URL patterns, forwarding requests to appropriate microservices while handling response aggregation and error standardization. The gateway acts as an intermediary that abstracts the complexity of the microservices architecture from client applications.

**JWT-Based Authentication** centralizes authentication logic at the gateway level, validating tokens once and passing user context to downstream services. This approach reduces authentication overhead in individual microservices while maintaining security across the platform.

## **Service Routing Strategy:**

**Pattern-Based Routing** uses URL prefixes to determine which microservice should handle each request. The routing table maps API paths to service endpoints with configurable timeouts and authentication requirements. This approach provides flexibility while maintaining clear service boundaries.

**Authentication Levels** support three access patterns: public endpoints (no authentication required), protected endpoints (valid JWT required), and admin endpoints (JWT with admin role required). This granular control enables appropriate security for different types of operations.

**Timeout Management** implements per-service timeout configurations to prevent cascading failures and ensure responsive user experience. Different services have different timeout values based on their expected response times and complexity.

## **Security and Reliability Features:**

**Rate Limiting** prevents abuse and ensures fair resource usage across all clients. The gateway implements configurable rate limits that can be adjusted based on traffic patterns and service capacity.

**Error Standardization** provides consistent error response formats across all services, making it easier for client applications to handle errors uniformly. The gateway translates service-specific errors into standardized formats.

**Request Context Injection** adds user information to requests forwarded to microservices, enabling services to make authorization decisions without re-validating tokens. This approach improves performance while maintaining security.

## **Cross-Cutting Concerns:**

**CORS Handling** centralizes cross-origin resource sharing configuration, enabling web applications to access the API while maintaining security. The gateway handles preflight requests and sets appropriate CORS headers.

**Logging and Monitoring** provides centralized request logging and performance monitoring across all services. This enables comprehensive observability and troubleshooting capabilities for the entire platform.

**Service Discovery** maintains the routing table that maps API paths to service endpoints, enabling dynamic service management and load balancing. The configuration can be updated without changing client applications.

## **Scalability and Performance:**

**Stateless Design** ensures the gateway can be horizontally scaled without session affinity requirements. Multiple gateway instances can handle requests independently, improving availability and performance.

**Connection Pooling** optimizes performance for requests to backend services by reusing HTTP connections. This reduces latency and resource usage for high-traffic scenarios.

**Caching Strategy** can be implemented at the gateway level for frequently accessed data, reducing load on backend services and improving response times for clients.

**Consequences:**

**Positive:**

*   **Simplified Client Integration**: Single endpoint reduces complexity for frontend applications and external integrations.
*   **Centralized Security**: Authentication and authorization logic is consolidated, reducing duplication and improving security consistency.
*   **Operational Visibility**: Centralized logging and monitoring provide comprehensive insights into platform usage and performance.
*   **Service Abstraction**: Clients are decoupled from individual service endpoints, enabling service evolution without client changes.
*   **Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Rate limiting, CORS, and error handling are managed centrally, reducing complexity in individual services.

**Negative:**

*   **Single Point of Failure**: The gateway becomes a critical component that must be highly available to ensure platform accessibility.
*   **Performance Bottleneck**: All requests pass through the gateway, potentially creating a performance bottleneck under high load.
*   **Additional Complexity**: The gateway adds another layer to the architecture that must be developed, deployed, and maintained.

**Implementation Notes:**

The current implementation uses Flask with a simple routing table for service discovery. Future enhancements could include dynamic service registration, advanced load balancing algorithms, and integration with service mesh technologies. The modular design allows for these improvements without major architectural changes while maintaining the core benefits of centralized API management.
