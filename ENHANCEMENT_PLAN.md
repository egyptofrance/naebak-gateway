# ðŸš€ Naebak Gateway - Enhancement Plan

**Date:** September 26, 2025  
**Status:** In Progress  

## ðŸŽ¯ **1. Goal**

To transform the existing `naebak-gateway` from a basic reverse proxy into a full-featured, production-ready API Gateway with advanced capabilities for routing, security, performance, and observability.

## ðŸ“Š **2. Current State Analysis**

- **Functionality:** Basic reverse proxy with static routing.
- **Security:** JWT authentication and basic rate limiting.
- **Performance:** No load balancing or advanced caching.
- **Observability:** Basic logging, no monitoring or health checks.
- **Extensibility:** Static routing map, not easily extensible.

## ðŸ”§ **3. Proposed Enhancements**

### **3.1 Dynamic Routing & Service Discovery**
- **Goal:** Implement dynamic routing based on service discovery.
- **Tasks:**
  - [ ] Integrate with a service registry (e.g., Consul, etcd).
  - [ ] Implement dynamic routing based on service health.
  - [ ] Add support for canary deployments and A/B testing.

### **3.2 Advanced Authentication & Security**
- **Goal:** Enhance security with advanced authentication and authorization.
- **Tasks:**
  - [ ] Implement OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect support.
  - [ ] Add fine-grained access control (RBAC/ABAC).
  - [ ] Integrate with a Web Application Firewall (WAF).
  - [ ] Add request/response validation and transformation.

### **3.3 Performance & Scalability**
- **Goal:** Improve performance and scalability with advanced features.
- **Tasks:**
  - [ ] Implement intelligent load balancing (round-robin, least connections).
  - [ ] Add advanced caching strategies (Redis, Memcached).
  - [ ] Implement request/response compression.
  - [ ] Add support for HTTP/2 and gRPC.

### **3.4 Monitoring & Observability**
- **Goal:** Implement comprehensive monitoring and observability.
- **Tasks:**
  - [ ] Integrate with Prometheus for metrics collection.
  - [ ] Create Grafana dashboards for monitoring.
  - [ ] Implement distributed tracing (Jaeger, Zipkin).
  - [ ] Add advanced health checks and circuit breakers.

## ðŸ“… **4. Timeline**

- **Week 1:** Dynamic Routing & Service Discovery
- **Week 2:** Advanced Authentication & Security
- **Week 3:** Performance & Scalability
- **Week 4:** Monitoring & Observability

## âœ… **5. Success Metrics**

- **99.9% uptime** for the gateway.
- **<50ms latency** for 99% of requests.
- **100% automated** CI/CD pipeline.
- **Comprehensive monitoring** with actionable alerts.
